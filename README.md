## Overview

This is a repository for our software engineering project.

## Objectives

This repository gathered the former project of the past year Software Engineering Project (2016-2017).
The main goal of this year is to improve one of the former project in some aspect we would find improvable.
- Improve
- Enhance
- Upgrade

Meanwhile we keep in mind the origin of the project:
To replace the skanect software by our own, home-made acquisition and processing software so that we no longer depend on proprietary software. Material resources will also be made available so that functional prototypes can be constructed by the students.

As a recall of last year, the project must respect the following criteria:
- Acquisition duration must not exceed 90 seconds in total
- Various processing of the data can be performed offline
- The system must provide watertight triangular meshes
- The system must allow for the import and the export of 3D textured
meshes
- The user interface must allow for the visualization (or preview), even
roughly, of the scan and individual acquisitions. Some additional processing and edition (remove parts, smoothing, do/undo, etc.) can be implemented once agreed by the tutors (CJ, DS)
- All the groups have agreed on the same sensors for the project. You can use either Kinect V2 or Intel R200 sensors (or both).
- Implementation must be in C++ only. IDE can be Qt or Visual studio (whatever you choose, please make sure you can recompile your
code interface in both IDEs). OS will be Windows only.
- The usage of extra libraries such as Point Cloud library, Eigen, etc. Is allowed but it must be discussed with the tutors beforehand (to
avoid exotic libraries).
